# PicoLowLevel

This is the code running on the board inside each module of **Rese.Q**.

## üì¶ Module Components

Each module includes the following components:

- **Raspberry Pi Pico W**
- **CAN transceiver**, with **MCP2515** and **TJA1050**
- **Two DC motors**, featuring:
  - **Pololu G2 24v13** driver
  - **Rotary encoder** with **48 pulses per motor rotation**
  - **150:1 gearbox**
- **One to three Dynamixel AX-12A smart servo motors**
- **AMS AS5048B absolute encoder**
- **64√ó128 OLED display**, with **SH1106 driver**

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Building the Project

To build the project, you need a working Arduino environment. You can use:

- The **official Arduino IDE**
- **VSCode**, with the [Arduino extension](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-arduino)
- Or simply **[arduino-cli](https://github.com/arduino/arduino-cli)**

### üìå Arduino-Pico

This project is based on the Arduino framework and specifically uses the **Raspberry Pi Pico core**, available [here](https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-pico). You can follow the installation guide in the repository's README.

### üìö Required Libraries

Currently, the only external library used is:

- `Adafruit SH110X` ‚Üí for controlling the OLED display

It can be installed via the Arduino Library Manager.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Build Options

In the **Arduino IDE**, select:

- **Board:** Raspberry Pi Pico W
- **Flash Size:** `2MB (Sketch: 1MB, FS: 1MB)`
  - **1MB** for the program code
  - **1MB** for data storage and OTA updates

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Before Using the Makefile

üîπ **Before executing any Makefile command, ensure you have installed `arduino-cli`.**


#### 1. Download Arduino CLI
- Go to the official release page:
  üîó [Arduino CLI Releases](https://github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/releases)
- Download the **ZIP file** for Windows (e.g., `arduino-cli_latest_Windows_64bit.zip`).
- Extract the contents to a folder, such as `C:\arduino-cli`.

---

#### 2. Add Arduino CLI to the System PATH (Optional, but Recommended)
If you want to use `arduino-cli` from any directory, add it to the **system PATH**:

1. Press `Win + R`, type `sysdm.cpl`, and press `Enter`.
2. Go to the **Advanced** tab ‚Üí click **Environment Variables**.
3. In the **System Variables** section, find `Path` and click **Edit**.
4. Click **New** and enter the path to the folder where you extracted Arduino CLI (e.g., `C:\arduino-cli`).
5. Click **OK** to save the changes.

---

####  3. Verify the Installation
Open **Command Prompt (cmd)** and type:
```bash
arduino-cli version
```


Before using the Makefile, ensure that you have installed the correct rp2040 core. You can do this by running the following command in your command prompt:

```bash
arduino-cli config init
arduino-cli config add board_manager.additional_urls https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-pico/releases/download/global/package_rp2040_index.json
arduino-cli core update-index
arduino-cli core install rp2040:rp2040
```

Additionally, to run the Makefile on Windows, you need to install MinGW-w64. MinGW-w64 provides a complete toolchain including the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) and other essential tools for compiling code on Windows. You can download it from the official [ MinGW-w64 website](https://github.com/niXman/mingw-builds-binaries/releases).

Once downloaded, add the folder
`C:\...\mingw64\bin`
to your environment variables as a new PATH entry.


Next, you need to install GnuWin32 Make from a new cmd

```bash
winget install GnuWin32.Make
```

Next,you need to install Powershell from cmd

```bash
winget install Microsoft.Powershell --source winget
```

Then restart the PC


To verify that the installation of MinGW-w64 was successful, open a new command prompt and type:

```bash
gcc --version
```

To verify that the installation of GnuWin32 was successful, open a new command prompt and run:

```bash
make --version
```
If there are no errors and the respective versions of both tools are displayed, proceed with the installation of the libraries.

Regarding the libraries, you can install the necessary ones using Arduino CLI with the following commands.


```bash
arduino-cli lib update-index
arduino-cli lib install "Adafruit GFX Library"
arduino-cli lib install "Adafruit SH110X"
```
To test that everything is working correctly, open a terminal in Visual Studio and run "make help". If there are no errors, you can run "make compile" to compile.
